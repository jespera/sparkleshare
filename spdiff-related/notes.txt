= Notes on ranking of spatches =

There have been discussion as to whether we would like to provide a language
(or other mechanism) for expressing the ranking we want to do on the returned
spatches.

There's a distinction we have so far not made: there's a difference between a
ranking property and a pruning property. A pruning property is used to
completely discard a result (and it can be optimizing if it closed/preserved
under extension). A ranking property is a property that allows one to decide
when a certain pattern is more desirable than another.

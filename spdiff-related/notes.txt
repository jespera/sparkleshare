= Notes on ranking of spatches =

There have been discussion as to wheter we would like to provide a language (or
other mechanism) for expressing the ranking we want to do on the returned
spatches.

There's a distinction we have so far not made: there's a difference between a
ranking property and a pruning property. A pruning property is used to
completely discard a result (and it can be optimizing if it closed/preserved
under extension).
